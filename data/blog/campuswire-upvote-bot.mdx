## Why Would U Wanna Do Dis

Are you and your classmates struggling with Campuswire participation grades? It's clear to all of us that this mandatory participation alongside a competitive grading method benefits nobody and jeopardizes collaboration in the process of learning.

It's a pain in the ass to manually upvote your classmates' replies. Just copy-paste the snippet below and it will do the work for you automatically!

## Simple Steps to Take

This won't take you any longer than a minute or two.

1. Sign in to your [Campuswire](https://campuswire.com/signin) account.
2. Go to [Class feed](https://campuswire.com/c).
3. Press `F12` on your keyboard.
   (Or `right click` anywhere on the page & click `inspect` on the pop-up).
4. Go to the `Console` panel & scroll to the bottom.
5. Copy-paste the code below.
6. Press `Enter`.

```js
const delayFor = (ms) => new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(() => resolve(), ms))
;(async () => {
  for (let p of document.querySelectorAll('div.post-preview-wrapper')) {
    p.click()
    await delayFor(3000)
    document.querySelectorAll('div.spark').forEach((b) => {
      b.click()
    })
    await delayFor(1000)
  }
})()
```

**Now You’re a DAD**
